In this ML session we treat topics such as as bagging, boosting, and learning parametric models by several optimisation algorithms. Here we consider modelling the number of rides each hour for a bike rental company; we also create and test a spam e-mails filter, and try to estimate the number of bidders at an eBay auction of coins.
