### ðŸ›  Machine Learning Problems

In this ML session, we treat topics such as:

- Bagging
- Boosting
- Learning parametric models by several optimisation algorithms

Here we consider modelling the number of rides each hour for a bike rental company; we also create and test a spam e-mails filter, and try to estimate the number of bidders at an eBay auction of coins.
